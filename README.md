# Porfolio-Optimization-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

Portfolio optimization is crucial for investors seeking to maximize their returns while minimizing risks. 
Genetic algorithms (GA) are powerful optimization tools that can solve this problem.
This method is designed to find the optimal combination of assets that maximizes the return on 
investment while adhering to certain constraints, such as the maximum allowable investment in any given asset or sector.
